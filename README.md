* In this data were looking the duration are customers rent out are bikes. We noticed ffrom the check out time that alot people that do use are bikes only use it for a day and there was a select few that kept the bike over one day.

* In this dataa were looking at the same information as before but we wanted to see which gender is useing are bikes and how long are they using it for. We noticed more males use are bikes than females. There also a unknow population that use are bikes which could be categories as male or female.

* Next we wanted to look at what days and what time during the day does people use are bikes. In the data we saw that alot of people betwween monday throught friday are using are bikes in the morning around 7 to 8 am and later on during the day from 5 to 7 pm. Based on the time from the data we can assume people are using it to go from home to work and back. During the weekend we saw alot of people use are bikes mid day. We can assume from the data that since it is the weekend alot people have alot more time to go and ride bikes during the day.

* We noticed from the data that alot of males are activly using are bikes throughout the weekend and more females use it during the weekends. We can assume that females use are bikes for more recreational purposes and males use it for more for work. The motivation why they do this is unknown but with more research we can find out why. Research methods that could useful would be surveys which we can email out after the use of are bikes.

* From this data we wanted see who actually uses are bikes whether they are a subscriber or an average customer looking for a bike. We noticed that subscibers mostly use are bikes. From this data we need to convert more people into subscribers and once we do we know they'll consistently use are bikes. 
# Summary
* From the information gather we can see that alot of men enjoy using are bikes for there own purpose we can also see that are male subscribers are using the bikes on a frequent bases which shows a need for the program. As for the female market place its no so favarable. Thats okay though. With the program we can maximise are efforts on the male population to get the most out of the program. Reason being is because most of customers are male and we should appeal to the highstest market and people who respond postively to the product and the program. As for females we would need something different different whether its a new product that target specificly them or a program that targets them. At the end of the day we dont know and would need to conduct further research and have meeting with are marketing and product to analyze such cases. 
* One thing i personally would want to add to the research is to see which age group is using are bike. Seeing which age group is using are bike can provide alot of benfits for no only are marketing team but are product team. With this we can design a product for each market to appeal to them which correlates to more customer satisfaction and the best marketing tool, word of mouth. 
* Another thing i would want to research is the uses for are bikes whether its going to work or recreational purposes. This bring so much vale to are product becasue it allows them to develope a even better product than the product we have now. For example if females are using it for recreation purposes we can a gear shifter to the bike to make it a smoother ride and add cushion see to make it comfortable. We could also try adding springs so there is less shock when driving over stray objects like rocks or sticks you randomly find on the side walk.
